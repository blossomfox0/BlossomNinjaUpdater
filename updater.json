    "changelog": "Fixed crashes with other Hitmansion mods <3 Make sure Blossom Ninja is at the top of the list and that Black Market suppliers is above the Comfy Safehouse Expansion. Sadly this mod most likely isn't compatible with Advanced Glass Panel (although it could be with the right order). Thank you to invalid for the help on fixing this one, and thank you to Anon52 and necromaster13 for reporting the bug!",
